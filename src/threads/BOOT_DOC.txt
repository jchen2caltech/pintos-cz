			     BOOTLOADER
			     ==========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: In the order that they are used, specify the areas of memory that
>> your bootloader code uses (both starting address and size) during the
>> bootstrap process.  Briefly describe the purpose of each memory area.
>> Note that you do not have to enumerate the structure of sector data or
>> anything like that; simply state the general purpose of the various
>> memory areas used by your bootload code.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Write a pseudocode description (e.g. at the level of Python and
>> English phrases) of the sequence of operations that your bootloader
>> performs when searching for, and then loading, the Pintos kernel.

>> A3: Did you have any difficulties making the entire bootloader fit
>> within the space allotted?  If so, what steps did you take to reduce
>> the size of your bootstrap code?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A4: Why did you choose your final implementation?  Did you encounter
>> any major obstacles or difficulties that forced you to change your
>> approach?  If so, describe the obstacles and how you overcame them.

>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
