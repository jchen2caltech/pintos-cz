---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or

1. Added the following fields in struct thread:
       int nice
       int32_t recent_cpu
       
   nice stores the nice value of the thread; recent_cpu stores the
   the recent_cpu value of the thread.

2. New global variable in thread.c:
       int32_t load_avg
   
   load_avg stores the system's load average.

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values

Yes. Given some threads with the same highest priority, which one
the scheduler will be choosen is uncertain. Our scheduler will
solve this with round robin algorithm to select fairly.

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

Indeed too much code in the interrupt will slow down the run-time of
the scheduler, then we tried to be as concise as possible in our interrupt
context, and by using "if" statements to avoid unnecessary extra works
for some situations.

The advantage of our design is it is very straightforward and concise,
as we kept necessary work to minimum inside the time interrupt, our
overall performance should be good. The only drawback is the high
frequency of recalculating thread priorities - which will definitely
reduce the overall performance. (once each four ticks...) The freqency
should be reduced, but to what amount still requires further research
to keep fairness for the scheduler.

We used macro definitions, which will avoid overheads of functions calls
and thus improving the entire performance of our scheduler. Hence our
fixed-point math is both straightforward and concise. The drawback
is that as we are keeping the working code in minimum, we do not check
for overflows in calculation. Hence, for a long formula, we have to break
it step by step - creating intermediate tmp variables -  to avoid overflows,
and hence do the calculation without much precision loss.
